Epifanio delos Santos Avenue, most commonly known as EDSA, is one of the most traversed road in Metro Manila given the geographical setting of the area. Given its accessibility, approximately 410,000 vehicles pass through EDSA daily which is way above its traffic capacity of 300,000 vehicles. This high number contributes among others factors give higher risk to road accidents such as vehicle collision, malfunction and unschedule road repairs which furthers increase the traffic issues EDSA currently has.

With this motivation in mind, this paper aims to provide insights from the incident dataset (August 2018 to December 2020) that is scraped from the Official Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Twitter page using Exploratory Data Anaysis and few statistical methods. The main goal of the report is to pinpoint and narrow down high risk area of EDSA as well as the time period and day of the week that should be classified as high risk.

To help us provide insights, ANOVA, Dunn's Test, Boostrap and Multiple Testing were used on the dataset. This helped us classify with confidence that Quezon City, Mandaluyong and Makati are the high risk cities in EDSA while San Juan have the lowest risk. Checking for the day of the week suggests only Sunday has a lower risk while the other days of the week have equal risks. The test for hours of the day determines two cluster with high risk, between 7AM to 11AM in the morning and between 3PM up to 5PM in the afternoon.

The insights mentioned can help MMDA in allotting resources to the high risk areas and high risk time period. They also focus their study on the said areas and periods to check for solution on minimizing the occurence of incidents. Lastly, MMDA should consider the high risk points as the main target for new or revised protocol to help alleviate the traffic in EDSA.
